Hi, I'm Amy Bearman. I'm a junior at Stanford University, studying computer science (AI emphasis). I moonlight as a software engineer at Google during the summers. When I'm not fixing my family's computers, I can be found working on side projects, teaching high school girls how to code, playing the piano, and travelling. I'm interested in machine learning, satire, gender equality, and, recently, blogging.
