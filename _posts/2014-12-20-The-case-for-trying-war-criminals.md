title: The case for trying war criminalss
---

Here's a thought experiment. Suppose that a person, with knowledge of an imminent terrorist attack that will kill many people, is being held by the government. He refuses to disclose any information. Torture is guaranteed to produce the information the authorities need. Is it ethical to torture him?

This problem is called the "ticking time bomb scenario," and it trips up many moral people. Should one value the life and well-being of one intransigent detainee over the lives of hundreds of innocents? In this case, is torture not only permissable but also morally necessary?

Maybe, but there's one problem with the ticking bomb scenario. *It's irrelevant.* There never was a ticking time bomb. It's an interesting thought experiment, but, in real life, things are never so cut-and-dried. In real life, there's conflicting information about the nature, timeline, and perpetrator of a threat. Terrorists don't behave as if they're in a Hollywood movie. A detainee has never given up the "abort" code to a nuclear weapon. What's more, torture is never a reliable source of information. Subject to pain and degradation, a detainee will say *anything.*  

In early December, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a 6,700-page report covering the CIA's torture program in excruciating detail. The Executive Summary and Findings and Conclusions of this report, written by SSCI Chairman Dianne Feinstein, is available [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/world/cia-torture-report-document.html). The full torture report is still classified. 

If you don't get a chance to read the report for yourself, here are the key points I gathered:

1. **The CIA's use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.**
The justification for torture  Torture regularly resulted in faulty intelligence as detainee fabricated information that misled the CIA. The CIA never adequately reveiwed the effectiveness of torture  

Multiple detainees fabricated information about terrorist threats, resulting in faulty information. However, the CIA claimed that the interrogation techniques "saved lives" and made use of "otherwise unavailable" intelligence. In its reports, the CIA omitted the relevant intelligence obtained from sources other than detainees subjected to CIA's techniques. 

2. **The interrogations and confinement conditions of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA let on.**
These techniques included: sleep deprivation, slamming detainees against a wall, nudity, waterboarding to induce near drownings, shackling detainees in stress positions for extended period of time, rectal rehydration, ice water baths, threats to detainees' family members, threats of indefinite incarceration, detainees kept in complete darkness, detainees kept in isolated cells with loud noise or music and only a bucket for human waste, lack of sufficient heating.

Why should we hold our leaders accountable?
