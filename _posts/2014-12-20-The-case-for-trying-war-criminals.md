title: The case for trying war criminals
---

Here's a thought experiment. Suppose that a person, with knowledge of an imminent terrorist attack that will kill many people, is being held by the government. He refuses to disclose any information. Torture is guaranteed to produce the information the authorities need. Is it ethical to torture him?

This problem is called the "ticking time bomb scenario," and it trips up many moral people. Should one value the life and well-being of one intransigent detainee over the lives of hundreds of innocents? In this case, is torture not only permissable but also morally necessary?

Maybe, but there's one problem with the ticking bomb scenario. *It's irrelevant.* There never was a ticking time bomb. It's an interesting thought experiment, but, in real life, things are never so cut-and-dried. In real life, there's conflicting information about the nature, timeline, and perpetrator of a threat. Terrorists don't behave as if they're in a Hollywood movie. A detainee has never given up the "abort" code to a nuclear weapon. What's more, torture is never a reliable source of information. Subject to pain and degradation, a detainee will say *anything.*  

The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a terrifying time. There were threats that al Qaeda was planning another strike against the United States. Just a week after the 9/11 attacks, powdered anthrax was sent to various news organizations and two U.S. Senators. To CIA directors, it probably seemed like there was a ticking bomb threat every day. Unfortunately for the CIA and the Bush Administration, fear and the expectation of future terrorist plots do not justify brutal and illegal actions in the name of national security.

In early December, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a 6,700-page report covering the CIA's torture program in excruciating detail. The Executive Summary and Findings and Conclusions of this report, written by SSCI Chairman Dianne Feinstein, is available [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/world/cia-torture-report-document.html). The full torture report is still classified. 

If you don't get a chance to read the report for yourself, here are the key points I gathered:

1. The CIA's use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.

2. The interrogations and confinement conditions of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA let on.

3. 

So the CIA torture program was brutal, mismanaged, not effective, and kept secret from the American public. 

But at least now it's out in the open, even if 56% of Americans believe that torture works. Why dig up the past? When President Obama took office in 2009, he released a set of torture memos in response to a lawsuit, assuring those involved that they would not be subject to prosecution. Obama urged the country to not look back. He said:

> This is a time for reflection, not retribution. I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke. We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history. But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity, nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past. Our national greatness is embedded in Americaâ€™s ability to right its course in concert with our core values, and to move forward with confidence. That is why we must resist the forces that divide us, and instead come together on behalf of our common future.



The Bush Administration made a hard, but justified decision in a difficult time to protect our national security. Right?

Actually, no.
