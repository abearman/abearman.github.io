Here's a list of posts I want to write:

* The hyper-successful Serial podcasts and how to write a good story

* Cheney and the torture reports

* How not to write (see my diary)

* The Sony hacks and cybersecurity

* Growing up, all my heroes were male

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
