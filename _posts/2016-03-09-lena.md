# The Lenna Story
## The girl with the feathered hat

It's an image that shows up in every introductory computer vision class. The photograph is of a young woman in a Captain Hook style hat, gazing over her shoulder with a Mona Lisa smile. It's usually shown in black and white. The image is closely cropped around the woman's face. It's usually referred to as "the Lena image."

This image has become a test image for computer vision research, a meme before we even had memes. Lena pops up in intro classes, in research papers, in blogs. She even has been featured in [this blog](). Her image has been de-noised, Gaussian blurred, had its edges detected and its pixels segmented.
 
I was Googling around to find the familiar image for my blog when I happened upon [this article](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml)
